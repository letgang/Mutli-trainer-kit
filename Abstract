The Multi Trainer Kit is a compact, all-in-one educational device that integrates several 
essential electronic instruments into a single platform, making it an ideal tool for students, 
hobbyists, and professionals. Instead of relying on separate bulky and costly laboratory 
equipment, this kit combines a digital storage oscilloscope, function generator, variable power 
supply, and IC tester into one unified system. Each module is carefully designed with 
microcontrollers and supporting hardware to ensure reliability, precision, and ease of use. 
The Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) enables users to capture and observe electronic signals 
in real time, providing accurate measurement of parameters such as frequency, amplitude, 
and peak-to-peak voltage. Built using STM32 and F303RE microcontrollers, it offers fast 
sampling and effective noise reduction, while waveforms are clearly displayed on an OLED 
screen. Complementing this is the *Function Generator*, developed with an ESP32 controller 
and an AD9833 DAC, which produces sine, square, triangular, and sawtooth waveforms. 
Operational amplifiers condition and amplify these signals, while users can control amplitude 
and frequency easily through a keypad, selectors, and an LCD display.
The Variable Power Supply forms another critical part of the kit, providing regulated and 
adjustable DC voltages through an SMPS and buck converter combination. This ensures stable 
and efficient power delivery to circuits under test, while an integrated digital voltmeter 
continuously displays the output voltage for user convenience. Additionally, the IC Tester, built 
around the ATmega328P microcontroller, automates the process of checking digital integrated 
circuits by applying input patterns, comparing outputs with predefined truth tables, and 
confirming their functionality. Supporting components such as trimmers, selectors, LCDs, and 
OLED displays improve usability, making the device highly interactive and user-friendly. By 
merging these four instruments into a single unit, the Multi Trainer Kit significantly reduces 
cost, saves laboratory space, and enhances portability. It serves as an excellent learning aid 
for academic laboratories, a practical tool for hobbyists, and a convenient testing platform for 
professionals engaged in circuit design and troubleshooting. Ultimately, the kit functions as a 
complete electronics lab in one device, bridging theory with practical application and fostering 
hands-on experience in the field of electronics.
